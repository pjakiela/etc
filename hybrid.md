### No, This Is Definitely NOT Hybrid Instruction  


The dean’s office has received a number of emails asking for clarification on the teaching modality that will be used in the upcoming fall semester.  To be clear:  this semester we will be in-person.  We here at the dean’s office anticipate a normal, traditional, business-as-usual in-person semester that is most definitely not hybrid. Here is a guide to the many differences between last spring's now-completely-unnecessary, obviously-no-longer-relevant hybrid system and this fall’s definitely-not-hybrid semester, with helpful tips for effective, totally normal in-person teaching.
 
1. Teaching modality. During hybrid instruction, instructors were required to provide content for in-person and remote students simultaneously.  This fall is different: ALL students will be attending classes in-person (except for those students who are required to quarantine after exposure to a known covid case, for whom instructors will be required to provide remote-accessible content).
 
2. Technology. During hybrid instruction, **all** instructors streamed in-person classes via Zoom so that they were accessible to remote students.  This fall, instructors will be able to **decide** whether to stream in-person classes via Zoom so that they are accessible to students in quarantine.  As an alternative, instructors may wish to consider engaging students in quarantine via other remote instruction technologies – for example, using walkie-talkies or CB radios, or even using technologies that have not been invented yet.  We are confident that our world-class faculty will be able to figure something out.
 
3. Risk assessment. During hybrid instruction, university leadership used a tiered and color-coded risk assessment system to determine when to shift the entire campus to remote instruction.  That risk assessment system will not be needed during the upcoming totally normal in-person semester. Instead, instructors may wish to develop alternative, individualized approaches to protecting themselves during periods of heightened on-campus covid risk.  For example, instructors may wish to teach wearing a space suit or scuba gear, or from inside a zorb.  These items may now be purchased using individual research funds.
 
4. Office hours. During hybrid instruction, many professors chose to hold drop-in office hours online.  During the upcoming term, office hours must be held in-person at an on-campus location.  For example, instructors may wish to reserve the campus track in order to hold office hours while actively running away from their students.

5. Covid testing. During hybrid instruction, the university organized a regular testing effort to detect coronavirus among students, faculty, and staff.  This testing regime is clearly not necessary during our upcoming totally normal semester. However, students, faculty, and staff are free to purchase at-home covid tests at walgreens.com if they so desire; please use discount code TOTALLYNORMAL21.

6. Budgets. During hybrid instruction, campus budgets were severely impacted by the additional expenditures associated with increased cleaning and social distancing requirements.  After extensive consultations with the Board of Trustees, we have determined that a more cost effective approach is to declare the pandemic over effective August 31, 2021.  We look forward to returning to a completely normal, in-person, definitively-not-hybrid semester this fall.

We hope you’ll find these tips useful as you prepare for the upcoming return to in-person teaching!  A number of faculty have asked what additional resources are available to support them as they develop in-person, definitely-not-hybrid pedagogical approaches suited to the upcoming fall term.  Here in the dean’s office, we like to say that we have the best faculty of any university in the world.  We know you've got it all under control.  Have a great fall semester!
